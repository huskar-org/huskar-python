Huskar SDK's documentation
===========================

The **Huskar SDK** enables service providers and service consumers to easily
work together and make it possible for Ops to control the service through
`a web interface`_ by using **switches** and **configurations**.

There are some :doc:`examples` for you to **get started in minutes** and a
diagram in the :doc:`introduction` which explained what **Huskar** is and for.

If you need further information please checkout the :doc:`api`.

For whom curious about the implementing details, see :doc:`design`
